In high-income countries like Iceland and Belgium, nearly everyone can afford a healthy diet, with less than 1% facing barriers. This success reflects strong social safety nets, smart food policies, and living wages that make nutritious food accessible. As a result, these nations enjoy healthier populations, lower healthcare costs, and more productive workforces. Their experience offers a powerful example for the rest of the world amid rising global food challenges. The path to universal food security is clear it's time to act and scale what works.

#### ðŸ¥— **Healthy Food for Everyone: A Reality in These Countries**

In Iceland, only 0.4% canâ€™t afford to eat well.
In Finland, Belgium, and Denmark itâ€™s under 1%.

These countries show us:
1. Nutritious food can be affordable
2. Smart policies make it happen
3. Healthier people build stronger nations

So why not everywhere in the world?

When food is affordable, children grow, economies thrive, and futures brighten.
